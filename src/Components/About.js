                 <p>I am a third-year Computer Engineering student studying abroad at Sakarya 
                    University in TÃ¼rkiye. I am passionate about web technology, full-stack 
                    development, and embedded systems.<br/>
                    I specialize in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces using 
                    tools like React.js, Redux, CSS, and HTML on the frontend, and Node.js with 
                    PostgreSQL on the backend.<br/>
                    Beyond software, I have hands-on experience with hardware projects, working 
                    with ESP32, Arduino, and nRF52840 (Nice!Nano) to integrate sensors, enable 
                    Bluetooth communication, and build IoT solutions.<br/>
                    I enjoy exploring innovative ways to enhance user experiences, connect 
                    software with hardware, and expand my knowledge of modern technologies.
